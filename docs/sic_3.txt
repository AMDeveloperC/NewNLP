In today's world, demand of cloud computing is increasing day by day because of its many advantages, like sharing hardware, software and absence of fear of losing data. As number of users is increasing for cloud computing, threat for protecting confidential data in cloud is also increasing. This has led the computer scientists and researchers to think for finding robust security system for cloud computing. Detection, correction and prevention provide the complete solution for the security of cloud computing. Cryptography is one of the solutions which can prevent the intruders to enter into clouds for hacking information. In our paper, efficient hybrid cryptography system, Hybrid Vigenere Caesar Cipher Encryption (HVCCE) is proposed which will prevent the cloud infrastructure in three main places, in client location, in the network and in server. This cryptographic security system is designed in such a way so that computation time for decryption of cypher text messages for the hackers will be more compared to any single cryptographic system.
