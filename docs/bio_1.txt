This paper presents the framework and results of the cluster analysis of a selected set of Arabidopsis (a leafy plant)많enes말n the presence of insect-feeding and wounding stress. We outline the methodology by which we coupled the results of a microarray experiment with theGeneOntology (GO) annotations of each많ene맚o produce aggregate relational맋ata. Our method combines two relational matrices: one matrix is derived from a fuzzy GO similarity measure and another is derived from the microarray맋ata맛sing a statistical similarity measure. Finally, we used a fuzzy clustering algorithm (NERFcM) and a validity measure (CCV) to cluster and validate the resulting relational맋ata. Results are presented that outline the functional summarization of the clusters. The methods presented here give microarray researchers additional tools to investigate relations between많ene만xpression마nd많enefunctions.
