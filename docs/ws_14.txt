Next-generation networks  as envisioned by ITU-T  are packet-based networks  capable of provisioning consistent and ubiquitous services to end users independent of the network  access technology  and devices used  RESTful web services are now being contemplated as a technology for service provisioning in NGNs  They are emerging as an alternative  which may be more adequate than SOAP-based web services in some cases  SOAP-based web services are modular applications that can be discovered and invoked over a network  RESTful web services  on the other hand  are defined as a network architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems  This article presents a survey on RESTful web services for service provisioning in NGNs  It introduces the concept of RESTful web services and reviews the state of the art of RESTful-based service provisioning in NGNs  It also provides an evaluation of the overall suitability of RESTful web services for service provisioning in NGNs  and discusses research directions  RESTful web services do show significant potential for service provisioning in NGNs  However  open issues such as publication/discovery and mechanisms for the development of complex session-based services need to be solved before its full potential can be realized
