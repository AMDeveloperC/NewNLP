Bioinformatics is an interesting combination of biology and computational sciences  which help scientists and researchers to do more biological experiments to improve the life of living being  Gene expression is fundamental biological basics of cell biology  It is also responsible for genetic as well as physical or biochemical characteristics of an organism  The study of gene expression analysis helps to predict resultant protein product  in identifying abnormal functioning of cells which may responsible for various diseases  and in designing new drugs  For analysis purpose  DNA Microarray is an important tool as number of genes can simultaneously be observed  The output of DNA Microarray is vast databases which need to be processed by computation tools to take out biological significance  Computation tools include various algorithms of data mining  pattern recognition  support vector machines etc  Vast literature is available which demonstrate different algorithms and their result for analysis purpose  To find unique algorithms which satisfies all the requisite constraints is still the research topic  In this paper  we try to discuss all the major computational tools  various major methods from last many years which are used as a trends in gene expression analysis  We also try to discusses major difficulties while applying these methods to databases for analysis purpose
