Web services enable the integration of applications in a Web environment. Due to an increased automation of Web service interoperation, intelligent Web services are recommended, such as semantic Web services. In this paper, we first introduce Web services and the concept of intelligent Web services. We then propose an agent-based Web service middleware. We focus on the intelligent Web services platform with existing standards instead of proposing other standards. In particular, we present an agent approach to dynamic Web services, which invokes access points of UDDI registry automatically and returns execution results for Web services. The proposed approach is used to build experimental solutions involving intelligent Web service systems. Finally, we give an example to illustrate a typical scenario in which consumers search Web services using our Web services middleware.
