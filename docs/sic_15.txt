Digital evidence is increasingly used in juridical proceedings  In some recent legal cases  the verdict has been strongly influenced by the digital evidence proffered by the defense  Digital traces can be left on computers  phones  digital cameras  and also on remote machines belonging to ISPs  telephone providers  companies that provide services via Internet such as YouTube  Facebook  Gmail  and so on  This paper presents a methodology for the automated production of predetermined digital evidence  which can be leveraged to forge a digital alibi  It is based on the use of an automation  a program meant to simulate any common user activity  In addition to wanted traces  the automation may produce a number of unwanted traces  which may be disclosed upon a digital forensic analysis  These include data remanence of suspicious files  as well as any kind of logs generated by the operating system modules and services  The proposed methodology describes a process to design  implement  and execute the automation on a target system  and to properly handle both wanted and unwanted evidence  Many experiments with different combinations of automation tools and operating systems are conducted  This paper presents an implementation of the methodology through VBScript on Windows 7  A forensic analysis on the target system is not sufficient to reveal that the alibi is forged by automation  These considerations emphasize the difference between digital and traditional evidence  Digital evidence is always circumstantial  and therefore it should be considered relevant only if supported by stronger evidence collected through traditional investigation techniques  Thus  a Court verdict should not be based solely on digital evidence
