The omnipresence of e-services running on various instances of pervasive e-infrastructures that are fundamental to the contemporary information society generates an abundance of digital evidence  The evidence in a digital form stems from a myriad of sources ranging from stand alone computers and their volatile and non-volatile storages  to mobile small scale digital devices  network traffic  ever-present applications comprising social networks  ISP records  logs  Web pages  databases and both global and local information systems  The acquisition and the analysis of this evidence is crucial to understanding and functioning of the digital world  regardless of the positive or negative implications of the actions and the activities that generated the evidence  In the case of the later  when the evidence comes from illegal  illicit and malicious activities  the protection of digital evidence is of major concern for the law enforcement and legal institutions  namely for investigators and prosecutors  To protect the integrity of the digital evidence  a number of security methods are used  These methods differ in terms of performance  accuracy  security levels  computational complexity  potential errors and the statistical admissibility of the produced results  as well as the vulnerabilities to accidental or malicious modifications  The work presented deals with the evaluation of these security methods in order to study and understand their goodness and suitability to protect the integrity of the digital evidence  The immediate outcome of the evaluation is a set of recommendations to be considered for selecting the right algorithm to protect integrity of the digital evidence in general
