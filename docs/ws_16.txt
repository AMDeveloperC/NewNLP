Web services are considered as solution for solving the interoperability problem and the challenge of integration  How to manage Web services more efficiently is a key problem to the applications based on Web services at present  This paper presents a framework for application server based Web services management named FASWSM  The main contribution of FASWSM is Web service adaptation  so that a Web service can be plugged into the application server (AS) as a Web service adapter which enables a Web service to be managed by the application server  Therefore  the Web services management efforts are greatly reduced by leveraging various services provided by the AS  The FASWSM also provides mechanisms for dynamical reconfiguration which improve the extensibility and flexibility of Web services management  The FASWSM has been applied to OnceAS 2 0 application server  and the experiments data show that FASWSM outperforms JAX-RPC in terms of Web service invocation
