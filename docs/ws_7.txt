WWW (World Wide Web) has become the richest resource pool of services and information. But most of services (e.g. real time stock quote information and Web mail service) are independent and distributed. If we need a new Web service that sends us an email when some stock quote reaches a specific price, a Web service integration tool is needed to compose the Web stock quote information with the Web mail service. This paper proposes a convenient and powerful integration tool to seamlessly integrate the existing Web services into new services. Our tool, called Web service integration tool (WSIT), provides the functionalities to record and modulize existing Web services, to design, modify and compose recorded Web services, and to play and test the new composed Web services.
