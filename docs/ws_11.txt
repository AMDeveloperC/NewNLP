In this paper, we present a formal description of Web services container architecture based on Z notation. This description major focuses on internal behavior of a Web services container on processing a Web services request. First, we present a formal model of tailored XML which provides a unified data structure for executing Web services specifications and data transformation. Then, we present a formal definition of a Web service within Web services containers using WebService schema based on WSDL Z notation. Furthermore, we formally describe internal behaviors such as service identification, operation identification, type mapping and adaptation. By using formal method, the semantics of Web services container architecture is consistent and analyzable. As the key to model dynamic behavior of Web services specifications and their interrelationships major lie on the formal definition of this specification in WebService, this formal description can provide an initial step for analyzing the correctness and consistency of Web services specifications and their combination through WSDL by using proof provided by Z notation.
