The web services model is used for interoperability of Heterogeneous and distributed platforms. In this paper we present how different orchestrated and choreography based web services collide each other and exchange information. Exchanging of information takes place by means of integrating choreography Web services with push based web service architecture. In global scenario application are built with web services for their own scenario. Each services follow different set of mechanism for e.g. Web services A follows push based service and service B follows poll based services and so on. In order to exchange the information between these two web-services we introduce a layer which acts as a common platform for service synchronization. We call this layer as Heterogeneous Synchronization layer (HSL). This layer acts as a bridge between global web services and our subscribed web services.
