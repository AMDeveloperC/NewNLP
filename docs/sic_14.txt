This paper analyzes the reconfigurable design principles of public-key cryptography and the characteristics of modular arithmetic iteration process  According to the analysis results  a structure-adaptive reconfigurable modular arithmetic unit for Public-key cryptography is implemented  which architecture is able to support both RSA and ECC(Fp) algorithms security parameters dynamic arbitrary changing  Based on 0 18 micrometer standard cell-library  the area of the chip is only 42000 mum2  Simulation results of post-synthesis indicate that the maximum operating clock frequency is 103 8 MHz  the 1024-bit RSA modular exponential operation period is about 45 ms  and the 192-bit ECC(Fp) point multiplication period is 17 ms on average
