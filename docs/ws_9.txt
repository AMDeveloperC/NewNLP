The use of services, especially Web services, became a common practice. In Web services, standard communication protocols and simple broker-request architectures are needed to facilitate exchange of services, and this standardization simplifies interoperability. In the coming few years, services are expected to dominate software industry. There are increasing amount of Web services being made available in the Internet, and an efficient Web services composition algorithm would help to integrate different algorithm together to provide a variety of services. In this paper, we provide a dynamic Web service composition algorithm with verification of Petri-Nets. Each Web service is described by Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) and their interactions with other services are described by Web Service Choreography Interface (WSCI). Our algorithm compose the Web services with the information provided by these two descriptions. After the composition, we verify the Web service to be deadlock free with modeling the Web service as a Petri-Net. We conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the correctness and performance of the composed Web service.
