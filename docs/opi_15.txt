Aspect extraction aims to extract fine-grained opinion targets from opinion texts  Recent work has shown that the syntactical approach performs well  In this paper  we show that Logic Programming  particularly Answer Set Programming (ASP)  can be used to elegantly and efficiently implement the key components of syntax based aspect extraction  Specifically  the well known double propagation (DP) method is implemented using 8 ASP rules that naturally model all key ideas in the DP method  Our experiment on a widely used data set also shows that the ASP implementation is much faster than a Java-based implementation  Syntactical approach has its limitation too  To further improve the performance of syntactical approach  we identify a set of general words from Word Net that have little chance to be an aspect and prune them when extracting aspects  The concept of general words and their pruning are concisely captured by 10 new ASP rules  and a natural extension of the 8 rules for the original DP method  Experimental results show a major improvement in precision with almost no drop in recall compared with those reported in the existing work on a typical benchmark data set  Logic Programming provides a convenient and effective tool to encode and thus test knowledge needed to improve the aspect extraction methods so that the researchers can focus on the identification and discovery of new knowledge to improve aspect extraction
