A gene network shows the interactions between genes. Previous research has successfully infer gene network from microarray gene expression data using techniques from diverse fields such as pattern detection, machine learning and data mining. In this research, we applied the statistical language R for gene network inference. R provides statistical language and programming environment for statistical computing and graphics. We observed that R only provides command line interface with basic comand buttons. Hence, we built a gene network inference application with Microsoft Visual C# as the visual front-end and R as the back-end for novice R users who are interested to use our gene network inference tool. Th application has tabs which represents each phase of our inference methodology. Each time a user select and click, the command will be executed through the visual interface. Therefore, users no longer need to use the command line. The inference of gene network from gene expression data is useful for predicting relationships between genes. Gene network inference is important because it enhances the understanding on genomic function and directly helps development in bioinformatics and medical field.
