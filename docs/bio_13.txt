Microarray gene expression and array CGH (aCGH) are two genomic approaches  which are widely used for biomedical discovery  While microarray gene expression analysis provides functional information  the aCGH analysis provides structural variations of genome using gene copy number analysis  The integration of this complementary information is challenging  We proposed a method  named as "gene shaving"  to identify subsets of the genes with coherent expression patterns and large variation across samples  We used the independent component analysis (ICA) to project the data into statistically independent biological processes  which are then integrated to identify variation patterns in two inputs  We applied the method to cluster group of genes  resulting better identification of genes that are statistically significant in both measurements (e g   gene expression and aCGH)  We investigated the properties of our proposed method by analyzing both simulated and real data  We demonstrated that the robustness of our method to noise using simulated data  Using breast cancer data  we showed that our method is superior to the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition (GSVD) gene shaving method for identifying genes associated with breast cancer
